# CVE-2024-1086

Proof-of-concept exploit for CVE-2024-1086, working on most Linux kernels between (including) v5.14 and (including) v6.6, including (but not limited to) Debian, Ubuntu, and KernelCTF. The success rate is typically around 99,4% (n=1000) to 93% (n=1000). 

The only requirements are that user namespaces are enabled (kconfig `CONFIG_USER_NS=y`), those user namespaces are unprivileged (sh command `sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone` = 1), and nf_tables is enabled (kconfig `CONFIG_NF_TABLES=y`). By default, these are all enabled on Debian, Ubuntu, and KernelCTF. Other distro's have not been tested, but may work as well.

**Note (details in blogpost):**
- the exploit may be unstable on systems with a WiFi adapter, surrounded by high-usage WiFi networks. When testing, please turn off WiFi adapters through BIOS.
- the exploit does not work on Ubuntu with 6.5 kernels
- the affected versions lower limit (v5.14) is caused by the exploit. The underlying vulnerability has been in the kernel since v3.15, so if you're below v5.14 make sure you update your kernel in case someone makes an N-day for your specific version.
